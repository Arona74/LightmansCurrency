**Language Name**
Please state the name of the language this is a translation for (for use in the [Translation Info](https://github.com/Lightman314/LightmansCurrency/wiki/Translation-Info) wiki page).

**Accreditation**
Please state the name you wish to be credited under on the [Translation Info](https://github.com/Lightman314/LightmansCurrency/wiki/Translation-Info) wiki page.

**Language File**
Please **attach** the `*.json` language file here. **DO NOT** copy/paste the files contents into this form.
The latest version of the language files (including the english file) can be downloaded from [here](https://github.com/Lightman314/LightmansCurrency/tree/main/src/main/resources/assets/lightmanscurrency/lang). Please be careful to not accidentally break json formatting (extra or missing comma's or quotation marks, etc.) as it will keep your language file from working.


Once this request has been made, your translation file will be included in the next build of Lightman's Currency.
