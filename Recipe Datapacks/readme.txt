Copper coin recipe datapacks:

How to install:
1- Identify which datapack corresponds to a tech mod that you have installed that adds copper ingots.
2- Download the CopperCoins_{modname}.zip file corresponding to your desired mod.
3- Place that zip file into your worlds datapack folder (i.e. .minecraft\saves\{world}\datapack)
4- Check if the datapack is activated by running the '/datapack list' command in minecraft.
5- If not enabled, enable it by running '/datapack enable "file/CopperCoins_{modname}.zip"'
6- Profit :)

If a datapack has not yet been made for your mod of choice, you may create one by downloading any of the other datapacks and editing the copper_coin_melt.json & copper_coin_mint.json files and changing the copper ingot id to match your mods copper ingot.
If you don't wish to make one yourself, or don't know how, feel free to leave a comment on the curseforge page or make a feature request in the Issues tab requesting that I make one myself.
