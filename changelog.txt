0.8.2.1
-Added the remaining vending machine colors (orange, magenta, gray, light gray, cyan, purple, brown) for both types of vending machines.
-Tweaked the vending machine textures to match the vanilla coloration's.
-Internal changes to make registering the colored & wooden blocks an easier process.
-Texture/model name changes to acknowledge that the default vending machine is white (where possible).

0.8.2.0
-Added boss entity loot tables for copper -> emerald coins to the config to allow better economy customization options for managing loot from boss creatures (ender dragon, wither, modded bosses, etc.)
-Boss entity loot tables now work with entity ids (I apparently forgot to include them when adding that functionality).

0.8.1.1
-Added a new menu that can be opened by clicking on an empty trade definition slot, whereupon players can search through all available items in the game and define the trade item in that manner.

0.8.1.0
-Trading Machines no longer validate their trade count when opened, allowing users to modify the trade count in creative and then return them to normal functionality.
-Trading Machines can now purchase items from customers, purchasing items from the item slots in exchange for money. This mode can be toggled in the trade-price screen.
-Trade buttons are now blue when the trade is purchasing items from the player, instead of selling them.
-Trade Machines now have 5 coin slots on the storage screen, allowing players to store money in the machine to be used when purchasing items from other players.
*All stored money is still located in the same place, so choose carefully when you want to collect the stored money.

Bugfixes:
Univeral traders now show the tooltips when hovering over the add/remove trade buttons like their non-universal counterparts.

0.8.0.6
-Wallets now use Curio's rendering system (when available), allowing them to be rendered on other valid humanoid/bipedal entities should another mod make them compatible with curios.
*When curios is not installed the wallets still render normally.

0.8.0.5
-Added a debugLevel config option to allow users to remove spammy debug messages from the latest.log
-Fixed an error that arose (didn't cause any actual issues, just spammed the logs with error info) when a creative universal trader had its size changed in a single-player world, causing client-side containers to attempt to perform server-side functions due to the unique nature of single-player client-server relationships.

0.8.0.4
-Removed some annoying debug messages leftover from the wallet upgrading feature.

0.8.0.3
-Added an additional shapeless recipe for the wallet crafting that allows you to upgrade an existing wallet to one of the next tier.
*Note: The crafting out does not display its copied contents/name/enchantments until after it has been crafted. It will appear as though it was in its default state until then.

0.8.0.2
-Fixed an issue where you were unable to collect coins from the main trading screen.

0.8.0.1
-Reworked and refined the enchanted book & enchanted item price calculations, so now the prices should be more reasonably generated.

0.8.0.0
-Added two custom villager types with their own unique sets of trades that allow you to make purchases with coins.
-Banker: Sells various trade-related items. Block: ATM.
-Cashier: Sells most items that are sold by vanilla villagers*, but you pay for the items with coins instead of emeralds. Block: Cash Register.
-Modified the Armor Stand Display trader to properly maintain its trade limitations for the first 4 slots should they be removed and re-added via the creative trader functionality.
*Disclaimer: I have attempted to copy over the trades with an approximately appropriate price (albeit significantly cheaper than just setting the cost in an equivalent amount of emerald coins), however some trades that have randomized or calculated costs may end with strange results, so please report these issues as you see them.
**Neither the banker nor the cashier will generate naturally in villages as I have not yet added structures to the villages with houses that spawn with ATM's/cash registers. They will, however, still transform into a villager of these types should you place an ATM/Cash Register near an unemployed villager.

0.7.3.4
-Fixed an error where the items in the trade definition slots were still being dropped when a trader is destroyed, allowing items to be duplicated in a trading machine.
-Fixed a server-crash when a player trys to change a traders name.

0.7.3.3
-Removed an annoying debug message that triggers when an entity dies.

0.7.3.2
-Flipped the order in which the title/owner of a trader are listed on the Terminal UI Buttons (formerly owner -> title, now title -> owner)
-Added buttons to the trader storage screen that allows owners of creative traders add/remove trades to the trade list (Trades are limited between 1-16).
-Added a button to the trader storage screen that allows owners to edit the name of the trader.
-Fixed an issue where custom trader names are not properly written/loaded to nbt, causing the custom name to be lost when the chunk/world is reloaded.

0.7.3.1

-In the process the MoneyUtil API now allows for the changing of coin conversion amounts post-init.

-Added similar config options to change the comparative value of coin piles/blocks should the user use a datapack or mod to change their crafting recipes.
-Changed individual coin value calculation to return a long instead of an int due to the new larger values a singular coin can have when config values are at their upper limit.
-Fixed a visual issue with the cash register right-arrow button placement.
-Reverted the title format of the cash-register trader screen to once again include the (X of Y) page title.
-Changed the minimum width of the trade display window to allow your average title to fit on the screen properly.
-Changed the trading/trading storage ui to avoid going wide for traders with 6 or less trades, as they still fit even at max gui scale.

*Developers Note: When the config values are all set to their maximum value, we are beginning to reach the upper limit of the java long when calculating the coin value of a filled wallet, so the upper limits on the config are unlikely to change any higher than the vanilla stack limit.

0.7.2.3
-The entity loot sections of the config can now take entity id's without loot tables and add spawn coin loot on their death when appropriate. Only works on LivingEntities.

0.7.2.2
-The Trading UI now centers the last row of trade buttons if it only has 1 or 2 trades.

0.7.2.0
-Added an Extra-Large Item Trader Server that can handle 16 trades. Note: May not fully support Minecrafts default GUI-scale.

0.7.1.0
-Wandering traders now have 9 additional trade options that use money as payment instead of emeralds.
-Added "addCustomWanderingTrades" to the common config to allow users to disable the new wandering trader trades. Default value is true.

0.7.0.3
-Fixed a missing loot table for the Freezer causing it to not drop itself when mined.

0.7.0.2
-Updated the trading /trader storage ui's to be wider, thus allowing those playing on GUI scale 4 to be able to access all of the buttons & slots at the top/bottom of the screen on the larger machines (although some of the visuals still go off of the edge at that size, everything remains functional).
-Changed the maximum trade count for any given item trader to be 12.

0.7.0.1
-Fixed an issue where non-owners of a universal trader can access the storage screen by right-clicking the server. The server's now confirm that the player is the owner before opening the screen.

0.7.0.0
-Added first pass at a universal trader/terminal system. Item Trader servers can now be placed and used from a trading terminal from anywhere in any dimension.

0.6.4.1
-Tagged all multi & trader blocks as forge:immovable to avoid issues with other mods attempting to move them. If another mod breaks them by attempting to move only part of a machine it's on their court now.

0.6.4.0
-Fixed an issue where the trader gui's would remain open and players could still interact with the trading machines and their contents after they were broken, allowing item duplication/destruction.

0.6.3.9
-Fixed an issue where money would be consumed, but no item(s) given should there not be room for the purchased item in the item output slots. A refund of the money paid is now given during these circumstances.
-More internal changes to make certain network messages more universally usable for other mods that wish to make compatible trading machines (I have one in development... spoilers :P)
-Partial development of the new Networked Item Traders. Nothing functional or accessable at the moment, but it's gettin there.

0.6.3.8

-Removed an unused optional dependency with Mr Crayfishes vehicles mod that could cause potential issues.

0.6.3.6
-Internal changes to make it possible for trading machines that don't sell items to be made in other mods, yet still be compatible with the cash register and other misc features from this mod.
-Fixed a visual bug where the items in a large vending machine would not render if you look at the wrong angle.

0.6.3.5
-Added a new freezer trader (can have 8 trades).
-Traders now keep track of how many players are currently using it.
-Changed the crafting recipe of the large vending machine to require a more reasonable amount of materials compared to its smaller variant.

0.6.3.4

-Added client config to whitelist certain block items to be rendered at the item distance instead of the block distance to fix rendering issues with items that are also technically blocks (such as flowers, cakes, redstone, string, etc.) Default values include all of the vanilla & lightmanscurrency items that should be rendered in this manner.
-Minor internal changes to accomodate the newly ludicrous amount of money the wallet is capable of storing, as the raw-value of the coins was causing an integer overflow.
-Coin piles/blocks can now be placed in wallets and used to make purchases. (The ATM will not interact with them in any form though, nor will the wallet automatically pick them up.)
-Coins are now rendered on the coin value widget, so you can make a more informed choice of price.
-Minor tweaks to the trade price screen to make it move/resize automatically should any future changes to the CoinValueInput height be made.
-ATMs, Traders, etc. now respect custom names on coins when sorting/stacking coins of the same type. Converting/spending coins will still remove the custom name.

0.6.3.3
-Fixed a server-only crash caused by a debug message using a client-side only function in the coin-melt tag -> recipe feature added in 0.6.3.0
-Fully fixed the visual bug with the Coin Mint arrow button's first frame.

0.6.3.2
-Fixed a bug where coins will be destroyed if you pick them up while your equipped wallet is full AND your inventory is also full.
-Fixed a similar bug where coins will be destroyed if there is not enough room in your inventory or the given coin slots for the change given when making a purchase.
-Doubled the storage size of all of the wallets.

0.6.3.1
-Fixed a visual bug with the Coin Mint arrow button.

0.6.3.0

-The wallet tooltip now shows the money stored in the same text format as the traders, etc.
-The coin collection button now shows the money available in the same format as the rest of the trader.
-Changed the price-set GUI to set the price by coin (similar to how the price is actually displayed), instead of just typing in a number.
-Untested: Coins whose minting material is defined by a tag (copper coins by default), should now be capable of being melted should an item with that tag be present.

0.6.2.1
-Internal changes to make it easier to get relative directions for rotatable blocks without copy/pasting the same code for each different block.

-Added new feature to the trading machines allowing players to change the name of the displayed item from the price edit screen. The name of the item in the display will change to orange to indicate that it's been changed.
-Fixed a visual bug where the wallet contents would not update client-side when modified by a trading machine causing concern as to whether the correct amount was taken, etc.
-Iron and higher level coins can now be used to fuel a beacon.
-All coinblocks can now be used as a part of the beacon's base.
